# HANDOFF — session log (newest first)

Each entry is one work session. Written at session stop, read at session start.
Concrete and honest.

## 2026-07-20 — branch main

**Task (owner):** students should get the razbiram.com style in *their own* Anki —
a downloadable styled deck, plus an example deck to try, carrying a razbiram.com
signature that says the platform is free for learners. Design commissioned from a
Fable 5 designer + solution architect, then implemented.

**Decided up front (owner):** both delivery formats (`deck.json` **and** `.apkg`);
style is a **toggle**, original models preserved.

**Done — all verified against Anki itself, not just our own parser:**
- **`.apkg` writer** (`src/apkg/write.ts`, `writeApkg`). The repo could read
  `.apkg` but not write one. Schema 11 (`collection.anki2`) via sql.js — no new
  dependency. **The DDL and the `col` JSON blob shapes were dumped from a real
  deck with `sqlite3 .schema`, not written from memory**, and the emitted file was
  imported with **Anki's own Python library**: 11 notes, 22 cards, deck tree
  `razbiram::Texte::Meine Familie`, notetype, fields and tags all intact. That was
  the design's one HIGH risk; it is now closed. Note GUIDs carry over (re-import
  updates, never duplicates); ids come from a new `stableId` so re-exports are
  stable. 12 round-trip tests assert the far side field for field.
- **Style module** (`src/style/`): `cardTheme.ts` (card CSS with the warm palette,
  coral accent, Studio CEFR scale, full night mode via all four Anki selectors;
  the signature; an ES5 card script) + `applyStyle.ts`.
- **Signature**: back face only — `razb·i·ram`, a real link to razbiram.com, and
  **"Kostenlos für Lernende"**, isolated as `RAZBIRAM_TAGLINE`.
- **Example deck** (`src/example/exampleDeck.ts`): 6 Bulgarian words, 3 CEFR
  bands, German glosses, downloadable from the landing page as `.apkg`.
- **UI**: style toggle, `.apkg für Anki` button, example-deck link under the
  dropzone; new `.rz-link` style. Driven in a real headless browser — deck
  dropped, toggle ticked, no console errors.
- Gate PASS, **59 tests** (was 39). Cards screenshotted in light and dark.

**Deliberate deviations from the commissioned design (both are the point, not
shortcuts):**
1. **Templates are rewritten only for two-field models.** The architect proposed
   rewriting everything `detectCardType` calls a "flashcard" — but that classifier
   answers "flashcard" for anything it cannot place, including 9-field vocabulary
   models, so the rewrite would have silently dropped example sentences and CEFR
   fields off the card. Everything else gets CSS only and keeps its own layout.
2. **The elaborate cloze / MCQ / image-occlusion templates were not implemented.**
   They only apply to models we now deliberately leave alone. The design document
   keeps them for when that changes.

**Then, same session — owner: "the repo should be for students, not technical".**
The students are young and mostly new to this, so:
- **`src/Guide.tsx`** — the guide *in the app*, where they already are: three
  steps, and the five questions that actually come up (the empty export first,
  since that is the top support case). A guide on GitHub would not be read.
- **`ANLEITUNG.md`** — the same in plain German as a portable document, so
  razbiram.com can host it later. Includes the honest privacy paragraph.
- **README rewritten** to the family skeleton, student-first: the guide link is
  above the developer section. The old one described the pre-pivot Python CLI and
  linked three screenshots that never existed.
- Copy de-jargonised throughout (`deck.json` no longer greets a newcomer), and
  **anchors were not styled at all** — links were invisible to exactly the people
  who need them. Fixed in `styles.css`.
- `docs/img/` now holds real screenshots: the app, and cards rendered through
  **Anki's own rendering path** (light + dark), with a note on how to regenerate.

**Open / blocked:**
- **Ingest route still unconfirmed** — the primary action remains a download.
- Hub Mini-ADR still to write; schemaId migration pending.
- Author link: the ECOSYSTEM mandates `leon-koellerwirth.com`, the old README used
  `leonkoellerwirth.de`. Took the ECOSYSTEM value — worth a check that it is live.

**Next:** a live card preview in the app — the style is still invisible until the
student imports the file, and it is the one thing the design specified that the UI
does not yet do. Then the hub Mini-ADR.

**Continuity warnings:** theme © razbiram.com now travels *inside* every
downloaded deck — the notice lives in the CSS string itself, keep it there;
razbiram.com's ingest contract is still `deck.json` only, the `.apkg` is for the
student's own Anki; templates stay untouched for models with more than two
fields; the CEFR scale is the Studio's and a test asserts it.

## 2026-07-10 (evening) — branch main

**Done (all live-verified on 5 real decks + real `generate_manifests.py`):**
- **Phase 3+4 built — the core was missing.** The old app only *stored* the dropped
  file; the button was `disabled`, nothing parsed. New `src/crowdanki/`:
  `deckJson.ts` (`.apkg → deck.json`, `::` tree, deterministic uuids), `uuid.ts`,
  `cardType.ts` (mirrors `generate_manifests.py`), `loadDeckJson.ts` (pass-through),
  `summary.ts`, `convert.ts` (unified entry), `download.ts` (bare `deck.json` / `.zip`
  + `media/`). App now: drop → parse → preview (deck, count, real card-type chips,
  sample cards) → download.
- **Two inputs.** Accept `.apkg` **and** an existing CrowdAnki `deck.json` (validate
  + pass through — the easy case, per owner).
- **Fixed crash "Unexpected token '(' … not valid JSON".** Modern `.anki21b` exports
  zstd-compress the `media` manifest (magic `28 b5 2f fd`) and its content is
  **protobuf** (`MediaEntries`), not JSON. New `src/apkg/mediaManifest.ts` decodes
  all three layouts (legacy JSON map / zstd+protobuf / empty). This also closed the
  old "anki21b not fixture-tested" item.
- **Fixed "empty json, very fast".** Root cause: the user's `.apkg` is **genuinely
  empty** — verified by two independent tools (Anki's own `.anki21b` = 0 notes; the
  CrowdAnki addon's folder `deck.json` = 0 notes/0 children). The 1 legacy note is
  Anki's "Please update…" placeholder. Fix: **pick the collection via `meta`** (like
  Anki), ignore compat stubs; and on 0 notes show a clear "no cards" message instead
  of a silent empty `deck.json`. Real decks still convert (573 / 365+117media / 270 /
  406).
- **`deck.json` viewer** (owner request): CodeMirror 6 (`@uiw/react-codemirror` +
  `@codemirror/lang-json` + `theme-one-dark`), mirroring the Studio's
  `JsonSourceEditor`. Read-only, line numbers/folding/search, light+dark, "ansehen"
  toggle + copy, **lazy-loaded** (main bundle stays 352 kB, CM in a 421 kB chunk).
- Removed the **fake A2/B1 CEFR badges** (meaningless for arbitrary decks → invariant
  §8) — replaced with real Anki card-type chips.
- Gate PASS (tsc + vite build + **23 tests**), dev server HTTP 200.

**Decided (see BIBLE §4, all ticked):** `.apkg→deck.json` built; two inputs
(`.apkg` + CrowdAnki `deck.json`); collection selection is **`meta`-driven** (stubs
ignored, empty → clear error); `.anki21b` zstd+protobuf media decoded; golden-set
implemented; CodeMirror `deck.json` viewer added.

**Open / blocked:**
- **No README yet** — write the student-facing README (skeleton) and name the deck
  round-trip golden-set. Nothing else names it.
- **Ingest route still unconfirmed** — so the primary button is a **download**, not a
  real 1-click "In razbiram.com übernehmen". Owner to confirm razbiram.com's route
  (repo layout / path / token scopes) before that becomes a real upload.
- Hub Mini-ADR (reverse role + CEFR table) still to write. schemaId migration pending.

**Next:** student-facing **README** (name the golden-set), then wire the real
razbiram.com **upload** once the ingest route is confirmed. Optionally: nicer 0-note
UX (its own info card rather than the error card).

**Continuity warnings:** theme © razbiram.com (attribute, don't relicense); output is
**CrowdAnki `deck.json` only** — the app owns everything downstream; import the hub,
don't copy; Bulgarian examples correct; the owner decides scope — execute, don't
over-ask. Collection selection follows `meta`, not "newest wins" — don't revert it.

## 2026-07-10 — branch main

**Done:**
- **Rescued an interrupted session**: finished the forward Python CLI
  (`EnrichedDocument` → `.apkg`, genanki), added an **AnkiConnect live-sync**
  (`razbiram-anki sync`), 23 net-free pytest tests, ruff-clean, CI green
  (3.11–3.13), and pushed the repo public
  (github.com/leonkoellerwirth-arch/razbiram-anki).
- **Pivot, per owner direction**: the reverse direction is the real product —
  a student's `.apkg` → razbiram.com. Mapped the ecosystem: razbiram.com ingests
  **CrowdAnki** `deck.json` + `deck.info.json` + media + `anki.manifest.json`
  from GitHub (format confirmed by reading `studywithme_db`), with simpler
  `studywithme-bg.vocab.v1` for flat vocab decks. `generate_manifests.py` is the
  coherence anchor for card-type detection + the deck.info schema.
- **Read the family constitution** (`razbiram-nlp/docs/razbiram-ECOSYSTEM.md`).
  Created governance per family standard: **CLAUDE.md**, **BIBLE.md**, this
  **HANDOFF.md**. Extracted the razbiram design tokens from `razbiram-nlp/web`.
- Moved the Python CLI to **`legacy/`**.
- **Phase 1 (scaffold + theme) built & verified**: Vite 8 + React 19 + Tailwind v4
  + TS app, mirroring `razbiram-nlp/web`. `src/styles.css` carries the razbiram
  tokens (© header) + the Studio CEFR scale + a new dark palette + a working theme
  toggle. App shell: node-mark wordmark, `.apkg` dropzone (reads the file, no
  conversion yet), razbiram-coherent look. `npm run build` green (tsc strict + vite).

- **Mapped the real app pipeline** (`~/dev/ai/studywithme-bg`, via subagent):
  raw `.apkg` parsing exists **nowhere** in the ecosystem — that whole step is the
  gap. The app consumes CrowdAnki JSON and has a full adapter chain
  (`ankiNoteParser` → `ankiDeckAdapter` → mcq/flashcard/occlusion + mixed-basic).
  It reads `studywithme_db` **read-only via a server token** (no per-student repo,
  no in-app push). A student **upload** surface already exists at `/learn/decks`
  (`POST /me/decks`) that accepts the app's **LearnDeck JSON**.
- **Owner set the final output (definitive):** the parser produces **CrowdAnki
  `deck.json`** — exactly the format razbiram.com reads from
  `studywithme_db/app/studywithme-bg/anki/<Deck>/deck.json`. That is the whole job.
  No LearnDeck adapter port (the app owns everything downstream of `deck.json`);
  no per-student GitHub repo. Earlier vocab.v1 / LearnDeck framings are superseded.

**Decided (see BIBLE §4):** reverse direction = focus; standalone web app; output =
**CrowdAnki `deck.json`** (+ media); reuse by producing the exact shape the app's
`ankiNoteParser`/`generate_manifests.py` already read (no port); CEFR scale = Studio
(emerald→amber); forward CLI frozen in `legacy/`; theme © razbiram.com.

**Open / blocked:**
- Hub Mini-ADR still to write (reverse role + CEFR table correction).
- razbiram.com's real ingest route (repo layout, token scopes) unconfirmed.
- Web app phases 3–6 not built yet (governance + scaffold + `.apkg` parser done).
- `collection.anki21b` (zstd) parsing coded but not fixture-tested (need a modern export).

**Next (Phase 3 — the one remaining core piece):** `src/crowdanki/deckJson.ts` —
turn `ParsedApkg` into a CrowdAnki `deck.json`: a `Deck` (`__type__`, `name`,
`crowdanki_uuid`, `children` = the `::` tree, `note_models`, `notes`, `media_files`),
deterministic `crowdanki_uuid`s (stable re-export = update), notes referencing their
model's uuid. Match the real shape in
`studywithme_db/app/studywithme-bg/anki/Varna__Biologie/deck.json`. Golden-set:
`.apkg` → `deck.json` → feed a small `prepareCrowdAnkiNotes` mirror and assert the
notes/models/fields survive; run the file through `generate_manifests.py` logic and
check card-type detection. Then Phase 4 UI (drop → preview → download `deck.json` +
media) + student-facing README.

**Reference deck.json top-level keys** (verbatim from a real file): `__type__`,
`children`, `crowdanki_uuid`, `deck_config_uuid`, `deck_configurations`, `desc`,
`desiredRetention`, `dyn`, `extendNew`, `extendRev`, `media_files`, `name`,
`newLimit`, `newLimitToday`, `note_models`, `notes`, `reviewLimit`, `reviewLimitToday`.
NoteModel needs `__type__`, `crowdanki_uuid`, `name`, `flds:[{name,ord}]` (+ `tmpls`,
`css` for fidelity). Note needs `__type__`, `fields:[]`, `guid`, `note_model_uuid`, `tags:[]`.

**Session tooling (family standard, added 2026-07-10):** `start.sh` (Vite launcher,
live-verified HTTP 200); deterministic `scripts/{state,gate,secure,session-snapshot}.sh`;
and `.claude/skills/{session-start,session-end}`. Open a session with **session-start**,
close with **session-end**. The repo memory is `BIBLE.md` (invariants + decisions) +
`HANDOFF.md` (this log) + `CLAUDE.md` (rules); the skills read/write them.

**Continuity warnings:** the theme is razbiram product IP (© razbiram.com) — attribute,
don't relicense. Output is **CrowdAnki `deck.json` only** — the app owns everything
downstream; don't rebuild adapters. Import razbiram-nlp from the hub; don't copy it.
Bulgarian examples must stay correct. The owner decides scope — execute decisively,
don't over-ask.
